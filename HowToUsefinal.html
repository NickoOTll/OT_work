    </ul>
    <h2>Step 1: Copy the Video URL</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Go to the website or platform where the video you want to download is located (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook).</p>
        <p>Find the video you want to download and copy its URL from the browser's address bar. Highlight the URL, right-click, and select "Copy."</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Paste the URL</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Return to the video downloader tool you selected.</p>
        <p>Look for the designated input field or box where you can paste the video URL. Right-click in that field and select "Paste" or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+V on Windows, Command+V on Mac) to paste the URL.</p>
    </ul>

        <p>After pasting the URL and configuring any necessary options, find and click the "Download" or "Start" button on the downloader tool. This will initiate the video download process.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 5: Wait for the Download to Complete</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>The video downloader will fetch the video from the provided URL. The time it takes to download will vary based on your internet connection speed and the size of the video file.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 6: Locate the Downloaded Video</h2>

         <p>Once the download is complete, the video will be saved to your designated download location or the location specified during the download configuration.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 7: Play the Downloaded Video</h2>

        <p>You can now play the downloaded video on your computer or device using a media player of your choice.</p>
    </Ul>
    <h2>Important Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Always ensure that you have the right to download and use the video content you are downloading, respecting copyright laws and the platform's terms of service.</p>
